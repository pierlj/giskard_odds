# Tell me the odds Giskard Technical Test

This repository is an answer to the [technicaltest](https://github.com/lioncowlionant/developer-test/tree/main) from
Giskard.ai.

The project consists in a CLI and a webapp able to compute the odds of success
for the Millennium Falcon to reach a planet before the Death Star destroys it. 


## Install notes
Simply setup a Python environment from the `requirements.txt` file: 

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Getting started
Once the Python environment is set up, the CLI can be used directly through the following command: 

```
python backend/odd_computation.py examples/example1/millennium-falcon.json examples/example1/empire.json
```
